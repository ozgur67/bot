# Algorithmic Cryptocurrency Trading Bot with Python on Binance Example Codes

The 'example' folder contains examples of bot's built by @BlockchainEng using python-binance. These bots are meant to provide a template/introduction to botting with Python-Binance.

## Getting Started

An [example Youtube Video by @BlockchainEng provides an introduction to the features of this project/bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AAN03M8QhA). 

[Example of Cryptocurrency Trading Bot Functionality on Youtube](https://youtu.be/Y4RwD1OGz4c) .

Additional explanation is available on a [Medium post describing additional functionality/considerations is available here](https://medium.com/@BlockchainEng/how-to-build-an-automated-cryptocurrency-trading-bot-on-binance-with-python-2cd9b5874e44) . 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
